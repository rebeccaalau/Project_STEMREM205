# Project_STEMREM205
Processing files for scRNA-seq data analysis (integration + automatic annotation) for primary, relapse, and combined samples. Automatic annotation references data generated from Olalekan et al. 2021, made available through https://www.weizmann.ac.il/sites/3CA/ovarian. ssGSEA was conducted and further analyzed with clusterProfiler to highlight enriched pathways between primary and relapse samples. CellChatDB was used to study cell population interactions in our ligand-receptor analysis.
